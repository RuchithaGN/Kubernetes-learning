# Kubernetes-learning
I’m thrilled to share that I’ve recently deepened my understanding of Kubernetes and its key components! 

Kubernetes has become an essential tool for managing containerized applications, and diving into its architecture has been both challenging and rewarding. Here’s what I’ve learned so far:

✅ Pods: The smallest deployable units in Kubernetes, containing one or more containers.
✅ Nodes: Physical or virtual machines that run Kubernetes workloads. 
✅ Services: Enable stable network access to Pods, even as they scale or move.
✅ Deployments: Manage the lifecycle and scaling of applications. 
✅ ConfigMaps & Secrets: Manage configuration and sensitive data securely. 
✅ Ingress: Define HTTP and HTTPS routing rules for services.


It’s been an exciting journey, and I’m looking forward to continuing to build my expertise in cloud-native technologies
